# Emotion-Recognition-by-Textual-Tweets-Classification-Using-Voting-Classifier-LR-SGD-
extracted emotions from textual tweets by using seven different supervised machine learning algorithms and also done with facebook scrapping to recognise emotions in facebook posts.
Social media has received a lot of attention recently through several social media platforms. Public and private opinions on a range of subjects are frequently expressed and shared. Sentiment analysis 
Sentiment analysis is a way to find perspectives for different people. Whatever it is, it can be a simple emotion or a strong opinion or something else. People usually give it out their thoughts on Twitter and social networking service. 
Tweets often help to generate large amounts of emotional data during analysis. This data helps us to understand people's opinions on different topics. 
This is also called opinion mining and derives the opinions and attitudes of the speaker. 
Without actually having to read through each tweet individually, machine learning algorithms are utilised to categorize the speaker's intent. 
Here Voting Classifier with combining LR-SGD gives most optimal results
